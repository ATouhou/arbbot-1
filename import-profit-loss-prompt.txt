The bot has detected that you have just upgraded to a new version which
supports storing the profit&loss information in the database which enables
faster retrieval times.

We now need to do a one time conversion of your current data to store it
in the database, and from now on your new trade's data will be stored in
the database automatically.

Before you start, please log in to your Bittrex and Poloniex accounts, and
download a full trade history CSV file from both exchanges, and pleace them
inside the application directory, next to config.ini.  You need to give
these files the following names in order for the application to pick them
up, otherwise it won't manage to match old trades.

  * bittrex-fullOrders.csv
  * poloniex-tradeHistory.csv

Please note that the names are case sensitive.

Press enter when you are ready to start.  This operation may take a while.
